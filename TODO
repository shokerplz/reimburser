How the hell this will work:
1) You give a pdf via cmdline argument
2) You enter start and end stations via cmdline argument
3) You get the result

- 1 Scan PDF and get trips Vector
- 2 Filter trips Vector start and end stations #DONE
- 2.5 Filter trips with intermediate routes. So if first one was a start, then take next one from this station on the same day and check if it ends with provided end station, repeat until day ends. #DONE
- 3 Filter trips only by workdays #DONE
- 4 Summarize and output (by day, by method of transportation and total) #DONE

Basic functionality is implemented. Wow!

trip_filter function should take vector of all trips NS + GVB, vector of stations Vec<&str> that are considered start and end and return vector of trips that are relevant to calculation #DONE

ns_pdf_scanner function should accept PDF file as a pathbuf and parse it via https://github.com/pdf-rs/pdf. Result should be two Vectors, one for NS trips and one for GVB.

Additional functionality:
 - Parse KPN receipt and send reimbursement form to Navan. #NEEDS_PLANNING
